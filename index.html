        <p class="p">Something's got a hold of me lately<br>
        No, I don't know myself anymore<br>
        Feels like the walls are all closin' in<br>
        And the devil's knockin' at my door, whoa</p>
        <p>Out of my mind, how many times<br>
        Did I tell you I'm no good at bein' alone?<br>
        Yeah, it's takin' a toll on me, tryin' my best to keep<br>
        From tearin' the skin off my bones, don't you know</p>
        <p>I lose control<br>
        When you're not next to me (when you're not here with me)<br>
        I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?<br>
        I lose control<br>
        When you're not next to me, mm-hm<br>
        Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby<br>
        You make a mess of me</p>
        <p>Problematic<br>
        Problem is I want your body like a fiend, like a bad habit<br>
        Bad habits hard to break when I'm with you<br>
        Yeah, I know, I could do it on my own<br>
        But I want that real full moon black magic and it takes two<br>
        Problematic<br>
        Problem is when I'm with you, I'm an addict<br>
        And I need some relief, my skin in your teeth<br>
        Can't see the forest through the trees<br>
        Got me down on my knees, darlin' please, oh</p>
        <p>I lose control<br>
        When you're not next to me (when you're not here with me)<br>
        I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?<br>
        I lose control<br>
        When you're not next to me, mm-hm<br>
        Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby<br>
        You make a mess of me, yeah</p>
        <p>I lose control<br>
        When you're not next to me (when you're not here with me)<br>
        I'm fallin' apart right in front of you, can't you see?<br>
        I lose control<br>
        When you're not next to me, mm-hm<br>
        Yeah, you're breakin' my heart, baby<br>
        You make a mess of me, yeah</p>
